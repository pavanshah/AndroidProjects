# Conway's Game Of Life

## What is Conway's Game Of Life?
Conway's game of life is a cellular evolution game. It creates certain cellular patterns based on different rules.
It works on following rules -
1] Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
2] Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3] Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4] Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
