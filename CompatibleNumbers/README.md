• Compatible numbers is an app which I developed while working as an android developer for San jose state university.<br>
• Many students face issues while solving complex multiplication problems as they don't understand concepts of long multiplication, factorization or simply don't know where to begin.<br>
• Our app helps these students by introducing the concept of Compatible numbers to perform multiplication.<br>
• Students can use our app to find compatible numbers by dragging and playing with an interactive canvas.<br>
• This makes learning Mathematics a fun activity.<br>
